# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to
understand product distribution, pricing patterns, and relationships between
different numerical features.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Visualization of price distributions and categories
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Most products belong to a limited number of categories.
- Pricing follows a skewed distribution with most items in a mid-range.
- Products with higher calories generally tend to have higher prices.
- Several numerical features show meaningful correlations.

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into retail product trends and pricing
behavior. These findings can help businesses optimize pricing strategies,
product planning, and inventory management.
